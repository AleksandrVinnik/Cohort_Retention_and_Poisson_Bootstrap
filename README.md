	● Project description: 

Assignment 1
Retention is one of the most critical metrics for a company. Your task is to write a function that calculates player retention (day by day from the player's registration date). The function should be written in Python.
 The data is located in the 'shared' folder and has the following structure:
'shared/problem1-reg_data.csv' – registration time data
'shared/problem1-auth_data.csv' – user login time data

Assignment 2
There are results from an A/B test in which different sets of promotional offers were presented to two groups of users. It is known that the ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) in the test group is 5% higher than in the control group. However, in the control group, 1928 out of 202103 players turned out to be paying, while in the test group, 1805 out of 202667 are paying.
Which set of offers can be considered the best? What metrics should be analyzed to make the right decision, and how?
